## üëã About Me


Hi, I'm Aaron ‚Äî a mid-career professional transitioning into cybersecurity. I previously worked as a Senior Executive in Audio-Visual, Lighting, and CCTV (AVLC) systems at Resorts World Sentosa Singapore, where I maintained and managed AVLC infrastructure at Universal Studios Singapore and other resort attractions.

Starting as a Senior Technical Specialist, I advanced through leadership roles and developed a strong interest in systems configuration, network troubleshooting, and programming. That curiosity sparked my career shift into cybersecurity ‚Äî a field that aligns with my passion for problem-solving and a deep desire to safeguard critical systems and protect the livelihoods of individuals and organizations alike.

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Applied Cybersecurity at the SANS Technology Institute. This portfolio highlights my journey through hands-on labs, CTFs, and security projects. I believe in lifelong learning, hard work, and doing meaningful work that secures what matters.
